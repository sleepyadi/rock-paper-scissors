# rock-paper-scissors
First Javascript project in The Odin Project foundations which has us create a rock paper scissor game for the console after learning the basics of javascript and then later on revamp it with a User Interface after learning about the DOM (document object model).


### TODO
- Add icons to buttons
- fix dimensions in css (after learning more about css)
- refactor js code for more readability
